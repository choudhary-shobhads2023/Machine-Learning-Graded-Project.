## Machine-Learning-Graded-Project.

# Problem Statememt 1:
You are hired by one of the leading news channels CNBE who wants to analyze recent elections. This survey was conducted on 1525 voters with 9 variables. You have to build a model, to predict which party a voter will vote for on the basis of the given information, to create an exit poll that will help in predicting overall win and seats covered by a particular party.

# Solution Approach:
* Performed Data cleaning, EDA, Data Encoding, Train-Test Split, Scaling etc.
* Build Various Models like Logistic Regression, LDA, KNN, Naive Bayes.
* Done Model Tuning, Bagging using Random Forest and Boosting.
* Applied GridSearchCV to all Models to check for the better Accuracy.
* Checked the performance of Predictions on Train and Test sets using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Plot ROC curve and calculated ROC_AUC score for each model.
* Compared the models and wrote inferences about which model is best/optimized.

# Problem Statement 2:

In this particular project, we are going to work on the inaugural corpora from the nltk in Python. We will be looking at the following speeches of the Presidents of the United States of America:

- President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941
- President John F. Kennedy in 1961
- President Richard Nixon in 1973
  
# Solution Approach:

* Find the number of characters, words and sentences for the mentioned documents.
* Removed all the stopwords from the three speeches.
* Retrieved Most Frequent Word Distribution in each President's Speech.
* Plot the word cloud of each of the three speeches (after removing the stopwords).

  Predicted election exit poll results with 85% accuracy using machine learning algorithms and analyzed U.S. presidential speeches, uncovering key sentiment shifts that informed campaign strategies
